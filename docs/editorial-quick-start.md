## Introducing

As mentioned in the main documentation, the coremedia-content-hub-filesystem plugin
provides access to a configurable path on the server hosting the Studio server. Common to all
content-hub-adapters is the appearance in CoreMedia Studio. The image below shows 
multiple configured content-hub-adapters in Studio (content-hub-adapter-filesystem is marked with a purple border).

## Browsing the content-hub-adapter-filesystem
Depending on the configuration of the adapter, the appearance of the tree may vary. The following sections 
take care of all configuration **places** and **options**.

### Basic adapter configuration
This section covers the two possibilities to enable the content-hub-adapter-filesystem integration. Please note that those
options are valid for all content-hub-adapters. Before configuring the adapter, please refer to the documentation [Content hub configuration](https://documentation.coremedia.com/cmcc-10/artifacts/2004/webhelp/deployment-en/content/Studio-Contenthub-Configuration.html)
for preliminary steps.

#### Global adapter configuration
To enable the content-hub-adapter-filesystem for all sites, it is necessary to create a CMSettings document located at:
* /Settings/Options/Settings/Content Hub/Connections/
For convenience reasons, naming proposal of this document is "Filesystem"

#### Site specific adapter configuration
To enable the content-hub-adapter-filesystem for a single site, it is necessary to create a CMSettings document located at:
* Options/Settings/Content Hub/Connections/ (relative to the site's root folder)
For convenience reasons, naming proposal of this document is "Filesystem" (name of the third party system)


### Detailed adapter configuration

#### Basic structure
The table below shows the initial toplevel entry for all content-hub-connector configurations.

| Key         | Type       | Required   |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| connections | StructList | Yes        |

After creation of the initial struct list called **connections** the next step is to create the first entry. This can be done 
in Studio with the struct editor by pressing "add Item to ListProperty". The table below shows the entries which are common for all connectors.

| Key           | Type       | Value            | Required   |
|---------------|------------|------------------|------------|
| connectionId  | String      | <SOME_UNIQUE_ID> | Yes        |
| factoryId     | String      | filesystem       | Yes        |
| enabled       | Boolean     | true or false    | Yes        |
| settings       | Struct     |                  | Yes        |
          

#### Required configuration
In section [Basic structure](#basic-structure) and according to the table, the settings struct is currently empty.
The settings struct itself holds specific configuration options for the connector (common to all connectors).
The table below depicts all potential entries. 

| Key               | Type       | Value                                                    | Required   |
|---------------    |------------|------------                                              |------------|
| rootPath          | String     | Absolute path where the adapter starts to build the tree from             | Yes        |
| filterNoAccess    | Boolean    | true or false                                            | No        |
| displayName       | String     | Name of the root folder to display in Studio             | No         |

#### Example
The image below depicts a full configuration of the content-hub-adapter-filesystem in global space

## Usage
Once the connector is configured, the "Filesystem" named tree appears in the library, and by clicking on "Filesystem"
the tree expands and is loading and showing content from the file system in the well known folder-content structure from CoreMedia. The image below shows the appearance.

By browsing the tree, the content-hub-adapter-filesystem provides an import mechanism for content objects. The picture below shows the 
button for creation (purple frame).
